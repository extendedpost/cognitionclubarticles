<p>Experts say depression is like a common cold, everyone experiences it at some point. For others it is a chronic illness.</p>
<p>
There are two categories of depression. There is Reactive Depression and Clinical Depression. Reactive Depression consists of responses to the environment. Clinical Depression is something entrenched. 
</p>
<p>
So let's dive into it.
</p>
<p>
When Reactive depression is present, there is a trigger. You can lose a relationship, an idea, a friend, a pet, or a thing. 
You will feel grief and disappointment.  This kind of depression is also known as the five stages of grief by Elisabeth Kubler. Your end all goal in this scenario is acceptance. 
</p>
<p>
In reactive depression, things to be mindful of is how you are influencing yourself. Does the trigger cause
you to have negative thoughts against yourself? Are you a bad person or feel bad about the event and blame yourself? This can keep you stuck in a negative cycle. What can we do to reinvest in life and laugh again?
</p>
<p>
You can start small with a goal-oriented focus. Identify the particular skill you can learn to improve your confidence. 
Some ideas are learn a new instrument, take a college course, start a book club or join a meetup. You can do something physical like start a walking program with a friend.
</p>
<p>
Professional help is beneficial here starting with a therapist. I recommend finding a therapist focused on grief counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy.
</p>
<p>
Now on to the big monster; major depression, also known as clinical depression. This is depression that becomes entrenched. 
This can be due to genetics, a chronic health condition, or a sudden onset of major depression. In major depression/clinical depression there is no major trigger. There is self-loathing, suicide idealization, and life being worthless. 
</p>
<p>
For this kind of depression, this is a brain illness. Where does one start if you suspect you have major depression?
</p>
<p>
A lot of the same things discussed in reactive depression
are beneficial steps for major depression. In the mean time, you will want to start out with engaging your primary doctor. Your primary doctor you want should be comfortable with psychiatric disorders. Your primary doctor should be patient, and let you go at your own pace. 
</p>
<p>
If there are no physical issues, your next step will be to follow through on a referral with a psychiatrist. They will create a specialized starting point for your particular situation. After that you can focus on your particular needs and begin buying services in mental health. 
</p>
<p>
As discussed, there are two categories for depression. They are reactive depression, and clinical depression. For self-care, you can start small things. As you become stronger, go big. 
</p>
<p>
Getting professional care for either reactive depression or clinical depression requires different strategies. For reactive depression, it's very specific to the grief cycle. Your primary goal is acceptance. Starting off with a therapist for the specific loss can help  you begin re-investing in life again. Mix this with learning something new to improve your confidence and shift your focus.
</p>
<p>
While major depression requires more advanced professional care starting off with a psychiatrist. Your first step is to see your doctor and get a referral to a psychiatrist. From there, you will have a plan moving forward to address your Clinical Depression.
